Zenphoto demo theme - Basic files
==================================

This is a basic theme that is meant as a starting point to write your own. These are the standard theme files/pages any theme should have as a minimum. 

The HTML included is stripped to the absolute minimum so the basic structure is more clear. 

Note that this demo theme is not setup for a theme based translation. 

See the theming tutorial on **http://www.zenphoto.org/news/theming-tutorial** for more details about theming.
